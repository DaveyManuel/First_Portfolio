                                <p>Hello world! My name is David Sanchez and I am 25 years old. I am currently a student
                                    attending the University of Miami. In 2017 I graduated from the College of
                                    Charleston with a major in International Business, and minor in Spanish. I chose to
                                    attend the Full-Stack Web Development program because I know that learning code will
                                    have a positive impact on my professional future, and I am excited to embark on this web
                                    development journey. Around 6 months ago I found myself pondering on where I would be in life in about 1-2 years. I realized that even though I had a Bachelor’s Degree in a field I was
                                    interested in, and was  </p>
                                </article>
                        </div>
                        <div class="row">
                            <article class="col-sm">
                                <p> 
                                    full of jobs, I noticed that the path I was walking down was
                                    not one I ultimately wanted to continue on. I figured that I needed something else
                                    to supplement my degree that would allow me to use my creative intelligence just
                                    as much as my critical intelligence. I came to the conclusion that Web Development
                                    would provide for me the opportunity to create, and use my brain in a way I knew I
                                    was more than capable of doing, however, I knew embarking on this Web Development
                                    journey would be one filled with many challenges.
                                    My whole life I have always been ready to hop on to the next adventure, and even though my
                                    ambition has served me well, I believe that it has also presented me with an innate
                                    unwillingness to sit still. In this 6-month long course I will need to have patience
                                    with myself and know that if I try hard enough, and don’t give up, I will be able to
                                    succeed. If I’m persistent in completing an objective, or project, I know that the
                                    feeling of accomplishment will have been worth the patience I put in. Having
                                    patience will also be important because even though I like things to be done
                                    instantly, I’m aware that 6-months will not feel instantaneous. Even though being
                                    patient with myself will be a challenge at times, I’m confident I will be able to
                                    use this virtue to ultimately aid me in my success, not just with this course, but
                                    with my life as a whole.
