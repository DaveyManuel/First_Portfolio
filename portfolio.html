              Said user can input the city of their choice and be shown the current weather for that city at the present
              moment, and a future 5 day forecast of the weather that will show. The city searched will be saved to the
              user's local storage and will appear whenever they type into the form field. Included in the results of
              the search are the general weather conditions, current temperature, highs and lows of the day, how the
              temperature feels like, humidity, wind speed, and UVI index whose color changes based on if the UVI index
              is low, moderate, or high.</p>

              create a work-day scheduler for a busy client. By using moment.js I grabbed the current day and current
              time and displayed both in the header of the planner. I created 8 columns to represent an 8 hour work day
              that coincides with the current hour of the day. By using the styles 'past', 'present', and 'future' I
              color coded each column grey, red, and green respectively. For each column when the save button is
              pressed, the text that is written in by the user will be saved. When the page is refreshed, the text will
              remain.</p>

              on your role will ask further questions. Once the user is finished adding all of their team members it
              will create an html page which shows all of the members with their pertinent role, name, email, employee
              ID, manager office number, intern's school, and engineer's GitHub.</p>
