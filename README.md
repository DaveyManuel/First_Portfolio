## Technologies

For my first portfolio, I have designed my html documents to have responsive design for mobile platforms. By using Bootstrap I have learned how to implement navs, navbars, buttons, forms, cards, and sticky footers. I have also learned how to efficiently use Bootstrap's grid system consisting of rows and columns. In addition, I also was able to design my components using bootstrap colors such as bg-dark, bg-gradient, text-white, text-warning, text-muted, and border-info. To add a background image I created my own custom stylesheet and modified the body tag by using "background-image: url();"

## Pages

For the convenient switch between my About Me, Portfolio, and Contact sections, I implemented the use of a navigation bar at the top of my page. This nav bar is consistent in all documents, and for each page I added a border to signify which page you are currently on. 

### About Me

In my About Me section I implemented a card component with a responsive image using the class "img-fluid". In order to make my text wrap around my image I created a row within the body with two columns; one for the image and one for the text. Below that I created another row with one column for the text. I chose to write about why I feel this class will positively affect my professional development in the future. 

### Portfolio

For my portfolio section I show the projects I have worked on followed by a brief description of each. 

### Contact

For my contact page I implemented the use of a card component with my professional links attached.
